**Swerve Drive Robot Final Design Project**

Welcome to our final engineering design project (E90) repository for our Swerve Drive robot! Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:

Project Overview
Our goal with this project is to develop a general-purpose Swerve Drive robot capable of precise movement and maneuverability. The Swerve Drive system offers unique advantages in terms of agility and control, making it an exciting challenge for us to explore and implement. We have integrated color and object detection as well as a gripper mechanism to emulate common warehouse applications that our robot could be used for in the future.   

Repository Structure
/src/main: Contains the Java source code for our robot's control software.
/docs: Documentation related to our project, including design documents, user manuals, and technical specifications.
/tests: Test code for validating our robot's functionality.
